    "# Fine tune a PyTorch BERT model and deploy it with Elastic Inference on Amazon SageMaker\n",
    "\n",
    "Text classification is a technique for putting text into different categories and has a wide range of applications: email providers use text classification to detect to spam emails, marketing agencies use it for sentiment analysis of customer reviews, and moderators of discussion forums use it to detect inappropriate comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past, data scientists used methods such as [tf-idf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf), [word2vec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec), or [bag-of-words (BOW)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model) to generate features for training classification models. While these techniques have been very successful in many NLP tasks, they don't always capture the meanings of words accurately when they appear in different contexts. Recently, we see increasing interest in using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to achieve better results in text classification tasks, due to its ability more accurately encode the meaning of words in different contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT was trained on BookCorpus and English Wikipedia data, which contain 800 million words and 2,500 million words, respectively. Training BERT from scratch would be prohibitively expensive. By taking advantage of transfer learning, one can quickly fine tune BERT for another use case with a relatively small amount of training data to achieve state-of-the-art results for common NLP tasks, such as text classification and question answering. \n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed service that provides developers and data scientists with the ability to build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models quickly. Amazon SageMaker removes the heavy lifting from each step of the machine learning process to make it easier to develop high-quality models. The SageMaker Python SDK provides open source APIs and containers that make it easy to train and deploy models in Amazon SageMaker with several different machine learning and deep learning frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our customers often ask for quick fine-tuning and easy deployment of their NLP models. Furthermore, customers prefer low inference latency and low model inference cost. [Amazon Elastic Inference](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/elastic-inference) enables attaching GPU-powered inference acceleration to endpoints, reducing the cost of deep learning inference without sacrificing performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This blog post demonstrates how to use Amazon SageMaker to fine tune a PyTorch BERT model and deploy it with Elastic Inference. This work is inspired by a post by [Chris McCormick and Nick Ryan](https://mccormickml.com/2019/07/22/BERT-fine-tuning).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we walk through our dataset, the training process, and finally model deployment. "

    "We use Amazon SageMaker to train and deploy a model using our custom PyTorch code. The Amazon SageMaker Python SDK makes it easier to run a PyTorch script in Amazon SageMaker using its PyTorch estimator. After that, we can use the SageMaker Python SDK to deploy the trained model and run predictions. For more information on how to use this SDK with PyTorch, see [the SageMaker Python SDK documentation](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using_pytorch.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, we use the `PyTorch` estimator class to train our model. When creating our estimator, we make sure to specify a few things:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `entry_point`: the name of our PyTorch script. It contains our training script, which loads data from the input channels, configures training with hyperparameters, trains a model, and saves a model. It also contains code to load and run the model during inference.\n",
    "* `source_dir`: the location of our training scripts and requirements.txt file. \"requirements.txt\" lists packages you want to use with your script.\n",
    "* `framework_version`: the PyTorch version we want to use\n",
    "\n",
    "The PyTorch estimator supports multi-machine, distributed PyTorch training. To use this, we just set train_instance_count to be greater than one. Our training script supports distributed training for only GPU instances. \n",
    "\n",
    "After creating the estimator, we then call fit(), which launches a training job. We use the Amazon S3 URIs where we uploaded the training data earlier."

    "Selecting the right instance type for inference requires deciding between different amounts of GPU, CPU, and memory resources, and optimizing for one of these resources on a standalone GPU instance usually leads to under-utilization of other resources. [Amazon Elastic Inference](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/elastic-inference/) solves this problem by enabling us to attach the right amount of GPU-powered inference acceleration to our endpoint. In March 2020, [Elastic Inference support for PyTorch became available](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/reduce-ml-inference-costs-on-amazon-sagemaker-for-pytorch-models-using-amazon-elastic-inference/) for both Amazon SageMaker and Amazon EC2."
